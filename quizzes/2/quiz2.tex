\emph{Please use this \LaTeX\ file as a template, and answer the following questions.
  Please be detailed in your answers.}

\emph{There are \ref{last} questions on this quiz. Please answer all of them clearly.

\begin{enumerate}%[itemsep=0.1 in]
\item What is the name of your TA?

\begin{quote}
Devlin Junker
\end{quote}

\item Describe the concept of scatter/gather I/O. How does one perform such I/O in C?
  What benefits or downsides does it have?

\begin{quote}
Scatter/gather I/O is a mechanism by which data can be read from or written to a file using multiple sequential buffers while remaining an atomic operation.  It can be performed using the readv(), writev(), preadv(), and/or pwritev() system calls.  The primary benefit of scatter/gather I/O is convenience and speed, as it eliminates the need to perform multiple I/O calls (or convert buffers with a single I/O call) in the event that multiple buffers need to be read/written.
\end{quote}

\item The third argument for \texttt{lseek} is \emph{whence}. What values can this
  parameter take on, and what does each mean?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Describe at least 3 ways to time your code. What are the positives and negatives of
  each method?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item What system call is used to change the timestamp on a file? What restrictions are
  imposed on you when you use this function?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Describe the process of installing a signal handler using \texttt{sigaction},
  including any specific issues that need to be considered.

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Signals can be handled in 3 ways. Name them. What constants are defined for your
  use in setting these actions? Is one way better to use than others?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Give the definition of the \texttt{siginfo\_t} struct, and describe each of the
  fields.

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item How do system calls and signals interact?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item What are \emph{async-signal-safe} functions? Give some examples, and explain why
  they are safe. What are some common functions that aren't safe, and why?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Describe the purpose and usage of the signal mask.

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item In what ways can a user send a signal to a process?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Different functions impact the timestamp on a file in different ways. Give some
  examples, the resulting timestamps that change, and explain why this is.

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item What is the purpose of the \texttt{/proc} filesystem? How is it used? What types of
  information can be found there?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Explain the idea of locales.

\end{quote}

\item What time did the epoch start, locally?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item Give a call to \texttt{strftime()} that would replicate the output of
  \texttt{asctime()}.

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item What are the different representations of time used by POSIX systems?

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\item There are several ways to duplicate a file descriptor. Compare and contrast them.
